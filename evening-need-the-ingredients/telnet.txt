After esentially using the same framework of code from today's To Do List
reading, I reformatted the variables 'tasks' to be ingredient (or ingredient)
so that the code was usable. differentiating between ingredients and ingredient
actually helped to determine which variables or folder paths were misbehaving.

The hardest part then was getting everything to work and getting
POST to actually POST. (insert joke about going postal)

Fact checking my text thoroughly was a big factor: instead of bashing my
head against a wall, I took a deep breath and re-read everything.
